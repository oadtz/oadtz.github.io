    about: `
    I am a web application engineer who lives in Bangkok, Thailand. I love to learn new things, especially in software development. As a hobby, I have built some websites. Please see my portfolio for those projects. My other fovorite hobbies are reading, travel, photography and watching movies.

    I have over 10 years working experience in multinational companies. My experiences are in different roles from developer to project manager. Thus, I am comfortable to work as a part of team or as an individual. Additionally, I have some oversea working experiences, at the headquater of Softscape Inc, located in Boston, MA, USA for 8 months and have been in Zurich, Switzerland for 2 weeks.

    In year 2018, I started learning on Data Science and Machine Learning. Right now, I am trying to gain more knowledge about them and want to build something cool and useful with these technologies. 

    Please stay tuned!
